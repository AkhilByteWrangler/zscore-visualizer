# üìä Statistical Explorer: Z-Scores & Distributions

An interactive Streamlit app designed to explore key statistical concepts such as Z-scores, normal distributions, and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). This app allows users to visualize the effects of changing mean, standard deviation, and sample size on various probability distributions, making it an excellent learning tool for students, educators, and anyone interested in statistics.

## üöÄ Features

- **Z-Score Calculator**: Compute Z-scores based on custom inputs for mean and standard deviation.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Adjust the mean and standard deviation to see real-time changes in the normal distribution.
- **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**: Explore the CLT by varying sample size and visualizing the distribution of sample means from a non-normal population.
- **Animated Normal Distributions**: Watch how changing parameters (mean and standard deviation) dynamically affect the shape of the distribution.
- **Real-World Applications**: Learn how Z-scores are used in finance, healthcare, and scientific research to identify outliers and standardize data.
